# nova
## What is it?
`nova` is a cli for tasks done on a regular basis. People started to want
to use many of these tasks themselves so I made this general version of it.
## API
### setup:dev
`nova setup:dev` will install `git`, `node`, `tmux`, `vim` and more

### setup:base
`nova setup:base` will install `tmux`, `vim`.
